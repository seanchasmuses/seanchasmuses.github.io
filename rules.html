This page is a heavily edited version of Bones' Raspberry Sorbet theme that I use for my muse list. Which is to say that I kept a chunk of the CSS for visual consistency, and to keep the page header consistent across all pages.

  <li><b>This is the rule where I ask you to follow general RP etiquette.</b> I consider this blog <i>Selective & Open</i>, which means that I don't always follow back, but non-mutuals are invited and encouraged to send memes, asks or IMs. Nine times out of ten, the reason why I don't follow back is social anxiety so sending a message first helps break that tension! I'm also OC & duplicate friendly.</li>

  <li><b>Common triggers will be tagged to the best of my abilities.</b> Personally, I struggle with subjects involving unreality or depersonalization, and just ask that you give me a warning before it comes up in any of our threads. If I forget to tag something, or you need something specific tagged, please let me know!</li>

  <li><b>Shipping ultimately comes down to chemistry and is limited to one ship per verse.</b> It's not something I set out to do, but I welcome it when it happens. I do not write explicitly sexual subjects and will always employ the use of fade-to-black.</li>

  <li><b>I have memory issues.</b> They border on pretty severe, so any time a post/ask/message goes unreplied to for an extended period of time the safe assumption is that I forgot it. This isn't because I'm uninterested, I just have a broken brain. Feel free to send me a reminder, especially if it's been more than a week since I last replied.</li>

  <li><b>I work a 9-5 job on the weekdays.</b> Most of my activity will be on the weekends. Which is why I say that if it's been over a week since I've responded, I probably need a reminder.</li>

  <li><b>I go by Beetle and use he/him pronouns.</b> I'm 27 years old, and live in the Eastern Time Zone. Mutuals are welcome to, and encouraged to ask me for my discord tag.</li>
